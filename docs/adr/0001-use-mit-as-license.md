## Context and Problem Statement

We are going to develop the software as open source, so we need
a proper license. Which license should we choose? 

## Considered Options
* MIT license

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MIT license", because we didn't really consider
any other license. The MIT license is well-known and widely used
among open source projects and it has an excellent license compatibility.
