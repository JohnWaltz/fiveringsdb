# Use MIT License

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: fatihi

## Context and Problem Statement

We are going to develop the software as open source, so we need
a proper license. Which license should we choose? 

## Considered Options
* MIT license
* BSD license
* GNU GPL

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MIT license".  
GNU GPL is too restrictive because it forces other projects
that want to reuse parts of our software to also license their software
under GPL. This might not always be feasible.  
MIT and BSD license are pretty much equal in their restrictions and permissions.
Since the original project that we conceptually forked from
was licensed under MIT license, we opted for the MIT license as well.
The MIT license is well-known and widely used among open source projects
and it has an excellent license compatibility.
