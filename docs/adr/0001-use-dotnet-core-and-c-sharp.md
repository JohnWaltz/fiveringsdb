## Context and Problem Statement

We inherited the project from someone else. Are we going to keep
the chosen programming languages or will we switch to another one?

## Considered Options

* Keep PHP
* Use .NET Core and C#

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: .NET Core/C#, because every member of the current team
knows C#, but not everyone knows PHP well.
